# Pytorch EO - Examples

Here you will find multiple examples on how to use Pytorch EO for different tasks.

## Image Classification

The task of image classification consists on assigning one label to an image.

- [EuroSAT](./eurosat.ipynb): Get started with this simple example.
- EuroSAT [advanced](./eurosat_advanced.ipynb): Learn how to leverage the power of Pytorch EO in this advanced example covering topics such as data augmentation, hyperparameter optimization, etc.
- [BigEarthNet](./big_earth_net.ipynb): Train an image classifier for a multi-label task.
- BigEarthNet [data fusion](./big_earth_net_df.ipynb): Learn how to train an image classifier fusing Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 imagery.
- [LandCoverNet](./land_cover_net.ipynb): Learn how to train a model for image segmentation.
