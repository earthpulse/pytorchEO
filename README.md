# Pytorch EO

PyTorch EO aims to make Deep Learning for Earth Observation easy and accessible for real-world applications and research alike. The library is a collection of:

- AI-ready EO lightning datamodules (sensors, data fusion, multi-temporal data, ...).
- Custom EO models and lightning modules (pre-trained on EO data, ready for fine-tuning).
- Common tasks (image classification, object detection, segmentation, ...)
- Utilities to work with EO data (optimized data loading, ...)

It is built on the shoulders of giants like PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning for scalability and easy deployment, with different level of abstractions so you can go as deep as you need.

Pytorch EO offers best in class integration with [earthpulse](https://earthpulse.ai/)'s tools ecosystem (AI-assisted data labelling, models repository, inference API, ...)
