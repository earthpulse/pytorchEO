# Pytorch EO

PyTorch EO aims to make Deep Learning for Earth Observation data easy and accessible to real-world cases and research alike. The main features of the library are:

- AI-ready EO datasets and lightning datamodules.
- Custom EO models and lightning modules.
- Scalable and Easy to Deploy.
- Integration with earthpulse's tools ecosystem (data labelling, models repository, inference API, ...)

It is built on the shoulders of giants like PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning.

ðŸš§  Under development

## Future Roadmap 

- Project skeleton
- Testing, documentation, pip project
- First datamodules (SCAN integration)
- First datamodels (Models Univers integration)
- Training example
- Deployment example (SPAI integration)
