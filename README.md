## Challenges

PytorchEO has been used in the following challenges:

- [EUROAVIA](./challenges/euroavia_hackathon_21) Mission: European Students Space Hackathon, 2021.
- [On Cloud N](./challenges/OnCloudN): Cloud Cover Detection Challenge (DrivenData, 2021).

<!-- ### Build your own Datasets

Using SCAN you can annotate your own data and access it directly through Pytorch EO. -->

<!-- ## Research

Pytorch EO can be a useful tool for research:

- Flexibility: build and experiment with new models for EO applications.
- Reproducibility: use same data splits and random seeds to compare with others.

See the [examples](https://github.com/earthpulse/pytorch_eo/tree/main/examples).

## Production

Pytorch EO was built with production in mind from the beginning:

- Optimize model for production.
- Export models to torchscript.
- Upload models to our Models Universe
- Use models directly through SPAI

See the [examples](https://github.com/earthpulse/pytorch_eo/tree/main/examples). -->
